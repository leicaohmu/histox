# histox.SlideMap

`histox.SlideMap` assists with visualizing tiles and slides in two-dimensional space.

Once a model has been trained, tile-level predictions and intermediate layer activations can be calculated
across an entire dataset with [`histox.DatasetFeatures`](dataset_features.html#histox.DatasetFeatures).
The `histox.SlideMap` class can then perform dimensionality reduction on these dataset-wide
activations, plotting tiles and slides in two-dimensional space. Visualizing the distribution and clustering
of tile-level and slide-level layer activations can help reveal underlying structures in the dataset and shared
visual features among classes.

The primary method of use is first generating an [`histox.DatasetFeatures`](dataset_features.html#histox.DatasetFeatures) from a trained
model, then using `histox.DatasetFeatures.map_activations()`, which returns an instance of
`histox.SlideMap`.

```
ftrs = hx.DatasetFeatures(model='/path/', ...)
slide_map = ftrs.map_activations()
```

Alternatively, if you would like to map slides from a dataset in two-dimensional space using pre-calculated *x* and *y*
coordinates, you can use the `sldieflow.SlideMap.from_xy()` class method. In addition to X and Y, this method
requires supplying tile-level metadata in the form of a list of dicts. Each dict must contain the name of the origin
slide and the tile index in the slide TFRecord.

```
x = np.array(...)
y = np.array(...)
slides = ['slide1', 'slide1', 'slide5', ...]
slide_map = hx.SlideMap.from_xy(x=x, y=y, slides=slides)
```

*class*histox.SlideMap(***, *parametric_umap: bool = False*)[[source]](_modules/histox/stats/slidemap.html#SlideMap)

Two-dimensional slide map for visualization & backend for mosaic maps.

Slides are mapped in 2D either explicitly with pre-specified coordinates,
or with dimensionality reduction from post-convolutional layer weights,
provided from [`histox.DatasetFeatures`](dataset_features.html#histox.DatasetFeatures).
